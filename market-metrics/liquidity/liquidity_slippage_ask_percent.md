## Details

Price slippage is the difference, often represented as a percentage, between the quoted price of an asset and the execution price of a market order. There can be many causes for slippage, but the primary cause is the size of a trade with respect to the composition of the limit orderbook.&#x20;

Letâ€™s say an investor wishes to purchase 1 BTC at the best ask price of $25,000 and they submit a market order. The top of the order book has a sell order at this price for 0.25 BTC, so .25 BTC is purchased at $25,000 per BTC. The next order in the orderbook is for 0.5 BTC, but at a price of $25,250. This is executed and 0.5 BTC is purchased at $25,250 per BTC. 0.75 BTC has now been purchased, and 0.25 BTC remain. The investor completes his order at the next offer in the orderbook, 0.5 BTC for $25,500. As only 0.25 BTC are needed to complete the 1 BTC purchase, the investor fills 0.25 BTC at the price of $25,500 per BTC. The effective execution price of this purchase is the average price of the individual orders, weighted by quantity:&#x20;

### &#x20;                          $$\frac{0.25\times\$25,000 + 0.5\times\$25,250 + 0.25\times\$25,500}{0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25} = \$25,250$$

The slippage is the percentage difference in the market price and this execution price:

&#x20;                                                        $$\frac{\$25,250-\$25,000}{\$25,000} = 1\%$$

So this hypothetical purchase of 1 BTC incurred 1% slippage. If the trade size was different, then the slippage would change; that is, slippage is dependent on order size.
