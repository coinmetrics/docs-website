## **Details**

* Active Addresses (Received) is the sum count of unique addresses that where the receiving end of a ledger change
* For this unadjusted version of the metric, all ledger change scenarios are considered.
* Such ledger changes can include mining, staking, transacting, account creation, etc..
* If an address was active multiple times as recipient during that interval, it is counted only once.
* For ETH, miners receiving fees from the original sender of a failed transaction are counted as active receiving addresses.

## **Asset-Specific Details**

* This metric is not available for assets that have full privacy, like Monero, Grin. For assets that have opt-in privacy features, like ZCash, it only takes the non-private activities into account.

## **Examples**

In a given day:

* Address A mines 10 coins
  * A was recipient, no sender
* Address B sends 2 coins to each C and D
  * C and D were recipients, B was sender
* Address D delegates 20 coins to E
  * D is the sender, E is recipient
* Address A burns 1 coin
  * A is the sender, no recipient
* Address F votes on a protocol change
  * F is the sender/initiator

We would count as active recipients: A, C, D and E. The value of the metric would therefore be: 4.
