# Addresses

Address metrics provide a proxy for **users** on a blockchain/network.

Increases in the number of active addresses suggests more users of the network.  Similarly, looking at addresses by tranche/cohort (e.g., counts of addresses with balances >X) can give a _sense_ for the _type_ of users in a blockchain network. &#x20;
