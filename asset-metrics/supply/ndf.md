## Interpretation

NDF is one way to assess Supply Dispersion. This ratio encompasses a broader economic group, perhaps equivalent to a combination of the middle and lower classes. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate supply in addresses holding more than 0.01% of a cryptoasset’s supply and dividing that figure by the total supply.
