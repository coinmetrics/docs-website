## Interpretation

The Puell Multiple provides insight into market cycles from a mining revenue perspective. Because miners are sometimes considered compulsory sellers given their fixed costs (e.g., equipment, electricity), this metric provides insight into the supply side of a cryptoasset's economy.   The idea being, that periods where the Puell Multiple is extremely low could be buying opportunities for investors, and periods where it is extremely high could indicate a profit-taking/selling opportunities.&#x20;
