## Details

* Free Float Supply is a measure of supply that excludes tokens are locked up or dormant for a long time. For example, tokens that are inactive for greater than five years, owned by company, blockchain foundation or founding team member(s) that may or may not be subject to escrows, burnt or lost, etc.
* Our free float value constantly shows a lower value than either the reported supply by foundations/companies or total visible on-chain supply.
