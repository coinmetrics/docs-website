## Details

* In this metric, compared to the continuous one, all sources of issuance are taken into account.
* This metric is the gross issuance: if in the same day, 100 units are issued and 10 burned, this metricâ€™s value will be 100, not 90 (which would be the net issuance).

## Release History

* Released in the 1.0 release of NDP
