# Supply

Supply metrics offer visibility into the **total number of coins** for a network/blockchain.&#x20;

Supply can be broken down in a variety of ways with Current supply representing all coins ever created, while Free Float supply represents only the supply that is likely to be available to investors (e.g., not locked up or closely held).  Issuance gives a sense for the new supply becoming available each day.  Other supply metrics involve looking at supply of a certain age (e.g., active in the last year or month) or the supply held by certain user cohorts (e.g., top addresses).   Higher levels of short-term active supply could represent more transactional network activity or fewer HODLs (e.g., more supply in motion), while large amounts of relative supply held in the largest addresses can represent a possible supply concentration risk.&#x20;
