## Details

* For UTXO chains, the heuristics used are:
  * Early spend: outputs spent one hour or less after being created are not counted
  * Round numbers: if one output has much more precision than the other outputs in the same transaction, itâ€™s not counted. For example, if a transaction creates 2 outputs, one of 1.00000000 BTC and one of 0.2561278 BTC, the second one would not be counted.
  * Self churn: outputs that have the same address as any of the inputs addresses are discounted
  * Also removed are cold wallet shuffles \(when an exchange changes their cold wallet addresses\) and other artifacts such as noise generated by early Bitcoin applications like Satoshi Dice
* For account chains, this metric is computed as the sum number of native units received by accounts, whose net balance did change in that hour.

## Asset-Specific Details

* For assets that have opt-in privacy features, like ZCash, it only takes the non-private activity.

## Example

* If in the same hour: 
  * \*\* Account A sends 50 units to B 
  * \*\* Account C sends 50 units to A 
  * \*\* Account B sends 50 units to E 
  * \*\* Account D sends 49 units to B 
* Then:
  * \*\* Account A has a net balance change of 0, received 50 
  * \*\* Account B has a net balance change of -1, received 99 
  * \*\* Account C has a net balance change of -50, received 0 
  * \*\* Account D has a net balance change of -49, received 0 
  * \*\* Account E has a net balance change of +50, received 50 
* \*\*\* Unadjusted volume is 199 
* \*\*\* Adjusted volume is 149 \(B: 99, E: 50\)
