# 1 Year Active Supply Velocity

## Definition

The ratio of the value transferred (i.e., the aggregate "size" of all transfers) in the trailing 1 year divided by active supply in the trailing 1 year. It can be thought of as a rate of turnover -- the number of times that an average native unit among the active supply has been transferred in the past 1 year.
