## Details

* Uncle Blocks \(also known as Ommer Blocks\) are an intrinsic feature of Ethereum.
* Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum does not discard blocks in situations where multiple miners find a valid block of the same height.
* Instead, Ethereum rewards secondary miners with so-called Uncle Blocks, which effectively represent a share of the work, as well as the reward, of processing transactions.
* Uncle blocks are not included in the assetâ€™s main chain but are referenced by main chain blocks. Both the main chain block and uncle block miners get an extra reward for this.

## Asset-Specific Details

* Only available for ETH and ETC

## Release History

* Released in the 4.3 release of NDP
