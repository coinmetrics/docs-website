## Details

* Computed as the current market cap over the 90-day moving average of USD adjusted transfer volume.
* Inspired by Kalichkinâ€™s work.  [Kalichkin \(2018a\)](https://medium.com/cryptolab/https-medium-com-kalichkin-rethinking-nvt-ratio-2cf810df0ab0) extended the idea behind the NVT ratio by introducing additional smoothing to correct for certain shortcomings in the original formulation that prevent it from being used as a real-time trading indicator.



## Release History
