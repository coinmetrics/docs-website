## Details

* This metric includes fees that are burned as part of the protocol.
* For chains that use median time, the day is defined using it, otherwise, it’s defined using the block’s timestamps.

## Release History

* Released in the 1.0 release of NDP

## Interpretation

Fees in USD terms (see Fees, Transaction, Median, USD; Fees, Transaction, Mean, USD, and Fees, Total, USD) are often biased by volatility in unit price, making it difficult to determine trends in fee pressure. Evaluating fees in native unit terms removes the noise from exchange rate volatility and enables more consistent time series comparisons.
