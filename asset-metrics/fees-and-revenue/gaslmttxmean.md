## Details

* Computed as GasLmtTx / TxCnt
* Gas is a dimensionless unit measuring the computational cost of operations for ETH-based assets. Each transaction uses gas when being processed. As it’s impossible to know how much gas every transaction will use before executing it, each transaction specifies a gas limit it’s willing to use.

## Asset-Specific Details

* Only relevant for ETH and ETC.

## Release History

* Released in the 1.0 release of NDP
