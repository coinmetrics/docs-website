* This metric is identical to `ReferenceRate` and `ReferenceRateUSD` but with different timestamp conventions. Please see the frequently asked questions below for more information on this topic.\

* This price is computed using our CM Reference Rates. Please see our [CM Prices Overview](../../market-data/reference-rates-overview.md) for more information on methodology and policies.
