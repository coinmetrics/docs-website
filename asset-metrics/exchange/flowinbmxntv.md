## Asset-Specific Details

* This metric might not be available for all assets. Either that exchange doesnâ€™t support this asset (BitMEX only trades in BTC for example), or we deemed that our coverage of the exchange was not complete enough to release the metric for it.
* For Bitcoin, this metric excludes the effect of change outputs:
*
  * If a transaction sends 90 BTC to exchange A but also withdraws 50 BTC from it, the flow is +40 BTC, not +90 BTC and -50 BTC.

## Examples

The amount of deposits in USD on BitMex is directly correlated with the total amount of BTC spot volume across all exchanges. We see the deposits of native units drop during 2021-22 following the price decrease of BTC..

## Release History

* Released in the 4.0 release of NDP

## Interpretation

This measures the flow of funds to the BitMex exchange measured in USD. Used to gauge activity on the exchange. Often times if an extreme amount of funds are being deposited to an exchange from cold storage, it could indicate users are selling to fiat or stable coins which could be be a bearish signal.
