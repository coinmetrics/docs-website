## Details

* This metric captures interactions between users of a cryptoasset and exchanges supporting that market. It excludes inter-exchange activity.
* If a transaction sends 90 units from exchange B to exchange A, it doesnâ€™t count towards this metric.
* If a transaction spends 10 units from exchange A and sends 5 units to exchange B and 5 units to unknown destination, it counts as a 5 units outflow for exchanges overall, 10 units outflow for exchange A, 5 units inflow for exchange B

## Release History

* Released in the 4.0 release of NDP
