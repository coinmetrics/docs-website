## Asset-Specific Details

* For account-based protocols, if both sender and recipient belong to Bitstamp, then the transfer is not counted.
* For UTXO-based protocols, this metric applies the following logic:
  * If the input addresses belong to Bitstamp, then only the outputs where the address doesnâ€™t belong to Bitstamp are counted as transfers from Bitstamp.
