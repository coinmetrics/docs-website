## Details

* Coinbase \(i.e., miner reward\) transactions are not counted.
* Exchange to exchange activity is excluded.
* Only exchanges and their addresses that Coin Metrics has identified are included \(i.e., not all exchanges and their addresses have been identified\) so this metric should be thought of as a minimum potential value.

## Asset-Specific Details

* For UTXO-based protocols, if any input address belongs to an exchange, the transactionâ€™s outputs are not counted.
* For account-based protocols, if the sender is an exchange, the transfer is not counted.

## Release History

* Version 4.2 of CM Network Data Pro Daily Macro \(End of Day\)
