## Details

* Coinbase \(i.e., miner reward\) transactions are not counted.
* Transfers between exchanges are counted.

## Asset-Specific Details

* For UTXO-based protocols, this metric applies the following logic:
* * If the input addresses belong to X, then only the outputs where the address doesnâ€™t belong to any exchange are counted as transfers from X
* For account-based protocols, if both sender and recipient belong to the same exchange, the transfer is not counted.

## Release History
