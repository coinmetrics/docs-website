## Details

* Computed as FlowOutKRKNtv \* PriceUSD
* Native units are considered as withdrawn if they leave the control of an address we identify as being owned by an exchange.

## Asset-Specific Details

* This metric might not be available for all assets. Either that exchange doesnâ€™t support this asset \(BitMEX only trades in BTC for example\), or we deemed that our coverage of the exchange was not complete enough to release the metric for it.
* For Bitcoin, this metric excludes the effect of change outputs:
* * If a transaction spends 100 BTC from exchange A but 90 BTC are sent back to it as change, the flow is -10 BTC, not -100 BTC.

## Release History

* Released in the 4.0 release of NDP

## Availablity for Assets
