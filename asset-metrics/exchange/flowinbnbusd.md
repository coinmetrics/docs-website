## Details

* Computed as FlowInBNBNtv \* PriceUSD
* Native units are considered as sent to an exchange if they are sent to an address we identify as being owned by an exchange.

## Asset-Specific Details

* This metric might not be available for all assets. Either that exchange doesnâ€™t support this asset, or we deemed that our coverage of the exchange was not complete enough to release the metric for it.
* For Bitcoin, this metric excludes the effect of change outputs:
*
  * If a transaction sends 90 BTC to exchange A but also withdraws 50 BTC from it, the flow is +40 BTC, not +90 BTC and -50 BTC.
