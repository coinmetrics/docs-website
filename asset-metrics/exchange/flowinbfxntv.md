## Asset-Specific Details

* This metric might not be available for all assets. Either the exchange doesnâ€™t support this asset, or we deemed that our coverage of the exchange was not complete enough to release the metric for it.
* For Bitcoin, this metric excludes the effect of change outputs:
  * If a transaction sends 90 BTC to exchange A but also withdraws 50 BTC from it, the flow is +40 BTC, not +90 BTC and -50 BTC.

## Examples

* During times of market stress or uncertainty, we see an uptick in BTC/funds being moved to exchanges. During the Luna collapse in spring 2021, we can see a rise in BTC being sent to both Bitfinex and Binance which is a precursor for more downside pressure as often times users are converting their funds into fiat or stable coins.

## Release History

* Released in the 4.0 release of NDP

## Interpretation

* This metric looks at the flow of funds being sent to Bitfinex and can give us a sense of market sentiment.
