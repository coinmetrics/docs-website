## Details

* Coinbase (i.e., miner reward) transactions are not counted.
* Transfers between exchanges are not counted.

## Asset-Specific Details

* For UTXO-based protocols, this metric applies the following logic:
*
  * If the input addresses belong to X, then only the outputs where the address doesnâ€™t belong to any exchange are counted as transfers from X
* For account-based protocols, if both sender and recipient belong to an exchange, the transfer is not counted.

## Release History

* Version 4.2 of CM Network Data Pro Daily Macro (End of Day)
