## Details

* All wallets (hot and cold) are considered to count towards the supply held by an exchange.
* This metric should be seen as an underestimation of the actual figure, as our heuristics and sources might not discover all addresses owned by an exchange.

## Asset-Specific Details

* This metric might not be available for all assets. Either that exchange doesnâ€™t support this asset (BitMEX only trades in BTC for example), or we deemed that our coverage of the exchange was not complete enough to release the metric for it.

## Release History

* Released in the 4.0 release of NDP

## Availability for Assets
