## Details

* Coinbase (i.e., miner reward) transactions are not counted.

## Asset-Based Details

* For account-based protocols, if both sender and recipient belong to Binance, then the transfer is not counted.
* For UTXO-based protocols, this metric applies the following logic:
  * If the input addresses belong to Binance, then only the outputs where the address doesnâ€™t belong to Binance are counted as transfers from Binance.
