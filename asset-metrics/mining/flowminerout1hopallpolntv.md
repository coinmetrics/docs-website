## Details

* This metric is part of the next iteration of our Miner Flows and it is the culmination of months of research on miner behavior and entity clustering.
* Miner-to-Exchange Flows can be used to better understand the impact that miners have on crypto markets.
* The ultimate goal of this family of metrics is to improve the understanding of when and where miners sell their coins.
* We have published research in this area in \(State of The Network Issue 91\)\[https://coinmetrics.io/following-flows-ii-where-do-miners-sell/\]

## Release History

* Released in the version 4.9 of Network Data Pro
