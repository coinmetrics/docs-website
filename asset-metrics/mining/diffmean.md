# Mean Difficulty

## Definition

The mean difficulty of finding a hash that meets the protocol-designated requirement \(i.e., the difficulty of finding a new block\) that day. The requirement is unique to each applicable cryptocurrency protocol. Difficulty is adjusted periodically by the protocol as a function of how much hashing power is being deployed by miners.
