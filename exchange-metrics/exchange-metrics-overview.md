# Exchange Metrics Overview

Coin Metrics calculates several metrics for exchanges such as `coinbase`, `binance`, and `deribit`. For example, the metric `volume_reported_spot_usd_1d` represents the daily spot volume in U.S. dollars for a specific exchange. Metrics available at the exchange level is available through the [`/timeseries/exchange-metrics`](https://docs.coinmetrics.io/api/v4#operation/getTimeseriesExchangeMetrics).

## Exchange Coverage

The available exchanges and the metrics available for each exchange can be found by querying our [`/catalog/exchanges`](https://docs.coinmetrics.io/api/v4#operation/getCatalogExchanges) or [`/catalog-all/exchanges`](https://docs.coinmetrics.io/api/v4#operation/getCatalogAllExchanges) API endpoints. You can also find a list of the exchanges in our coverage universe, the start date of our coverage, and the types of markets we collect by going to our [Market Data Exchange Coverage](https://docs.coinmetrics.io/exchanges/all-exchanges).
