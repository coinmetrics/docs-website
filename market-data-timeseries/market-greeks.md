# Market Greeks

## **Definition**

Option greeks represent the sensitivity of the price of an options contract with respect to changes in its underlying parameters. Greeks are used in risk management and hedging so that market participants can achieve their desired exposure.

## **Details**

Exchanges report the following greeks:

* Vega: The first derivative of the option’s price to the volatility of the underlying asset’s price.
* Theta: The first derivative of the option’s price to the passage of time.
* Rho: The first derivative of the option’s price to the risk free interest rate.
* Delta: The first derivative of the option’s price to the underlying asset’s price.
* Gamma: The second derivative of the option’s price to the underlying asset’s price.
