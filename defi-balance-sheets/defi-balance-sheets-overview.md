Coin Metrics collects various data from DeFi protocols and we serve this data in the form of DeFi balance sheets from our  [`/timeseries/defi-balance-sheets`](https://docs.coinmetrics.io/api/v4#operation/getDefiBalanceSheets) API endpoint.&#x20;

## Protocol Coverage

| `time`                       | The time in ISO 8601 date-time format. Always with nanoseconds precision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `assets_total_usd`           | The valuation of total assets, in USD value, that have been allocated to the protocol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `assets_total_count`         | The count of unique assets allocated to the protocol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `assets`                     | An array of summary info associated with each asset allocated to the protocol, including _asset_, which represents the ticker of the constituent asset; _total\_units_, which represents the total units of the constituent asset in this protocol; _total\_usd_, which represents the total USD value that asset represents; and _total\_share_, which represents the ratio of total USD valuation of that asset relative to the total USD valuation of the assets allocated to the protocol.                                                                           |
| `loans_lent_total_usd`       | <p>The amount, in USD, that the protocol has lent out to users of the platform. Protocols</p><p>like AAVE loan user deposits to borrowers. As a reminder, our balance sheet takes the</p><p>perspective of the protocol itself. Since these loans are expected to be repaid to the</p><p>protocol, they fall into the assets column as a type receivable.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `tvl_total_usd`              | <p>The Total Value Locked (TVL) of the protocol. TVL differs from Total Assets, as it</p><p>represents the assets that are within the protocol and have not been lent out. In other</p><p>words, the difference between TVL and Total Assets represents the aggregate value of</p><p>loans made by the protocol.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `liabilities_total_usd`      | <p>The total value, in USD, of liability tokens issued by the protocol. Liability tokens are</p><p>issued to users that have deposited cryptoassets into the protocol, similar to capital deposited by customers at a bank. These are tokens exclusively minted by DeFi</p><p>protocols and usually follow specific nomenclature standards. For example, AAVE</p><p>issues a-tokens like aUSDC, whereas compound issues c-tokens like cUSDC.</p>                                                                                                                         |
| `liabilities_total_count`    | <p>The total count of different types of liabilities issued by the protocol. For example, if</p><p>AAVE were to exclusively issue aUSDC and aUSDT, this field would return a value of 2.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `liabilities`                | <p>An array showcasing summary information associated with each liability issued by the</p><p>protocol, including <em>asset</em>, which represents the ticker of the constituent liability;</p><p><em>total_units</em>, which represents the total units of the constituent asset in this protocol;</p><p><em>total_usd</em>, which represents the total USD value that asset represents; and <em>share</em>,</p><p>which represents the ratio of total USD valuation of that liability relative to the total USD valuation of the assets allocated to the protocol.</p> |
| `net_working_capital_usd`    | <p>Net Working Capital represents the difference between TVL (<em>tvl_total_usd</em>) and</p><p>Total Liabilities (<em>liabilities_total_usd</em>). This ratio can be interpreted as a</p><p>measure of the protocolâ€™s ability to meet its short-term obligations, such as the</p><p>repayment of its liabilities (e.g. a-tokens).</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `protocol_utilization_ratio` | <p>The Protocol Utilization Ratio represents the ratio of loans made by the protocol</p><p>(<em>loans_lent_total_usd</em>) divided by its liabilities (<em>liabilities_total_usd</em>). As such, it is intended to represent how much the protocol is being used. In lending protocols, for example, this metric would reflect how efficiently the protocol is generating loans with its deposited capital.</p>                                                                                                                                                          |
| `liquid_supply_ratio`        | <p>The Liquid Supply Ratio represents the ratio between TVL (<em>tvl_total_usd</em>) and Total</p><p>Liabilities (<em>liabilities_total_usd</em>). In lending protocols, for example, this can be</p><p>interpreted as the percentage of the supply allocated to the protocol that is liquid and</p><p>can be used for loans.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `current_ratio`              | <p>If users make the assumption that a DeFi lender's liabilities (deposited capital from</p><p>Aave users) can mostly be considered short-term liabilities, then the current ratio can be</p><p>conservatively approximated by TVL (<em>tvl_total_usd</em>) / Total Liabilities</p><p>(<em>liabilities_total_usd</em>), which is the same as the Liquid Supply Ratio above.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `debt_to_assets_ratio`       | <p>The Debt to Assets Ratio represents the ratio between Total Liabilities</p><p>(<em>liabilities_total_usd</em>) and Total Assets (<em>assets_total_usd</em>). For many</p><p>protocols, especially lending platforms, this ratio is expected to always be close to 1</p><p>given the dynamics of DeFi loans.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
