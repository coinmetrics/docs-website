To the maximum extent possible, Coin Metrics has created a free float adjustment methodology that can be applied consistently, uniformly and objectively across all of our indexes.&#x20;

This document is intended to be read in conjunction with other Coin Metrics documentation that inform the data inputs. These include the CM Network Data Pro File Spec and the CM Network Data Pro Encyclopedia.\
