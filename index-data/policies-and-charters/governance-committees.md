# Governance Committees

Two primary committees provide oversight and governance for the production of crypto asset indexes and benchmark administration for Coin Metrics Bletchley Indexes (“CMBI”).&#x20;

* The Oversight Committee ("OC") is the primary oversight and governance body.  It is responsible for maintaining the integrity of all CMBI products by ensuring that they are designed and operated in line with appropriate technical and operational standards. The OC is responsible for ensuring that all CMBI products perform as outlined in their respective methodologies and to the required standards of Coin Metrics.
* The Index Committee ("IC") oversees the daily operations of indexes, including index strategy, methodology oversight, incident management, policy adherence, input data quality, client management and index risk management.
