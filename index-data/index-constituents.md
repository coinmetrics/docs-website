# Index Constituents

## **Definition**

An index constituent is a member of an index.  For multi-asset crypto indexes, a constituent is a cryptoasset.  

| **Name** | **Category** | **Subcategory** | **Type** | **Unit** | **Interval** |

| Index constituents | Index | Constituents | Index data | n/a | Hourly |

## Details

* Certain indexes consist of multiple index constituents. Such indexes weight constituents by one or more factors to determine the composition of the index. For instance, market capitalization weighted indexes weight index constituents by their adjusted free float market capitalization. For each index that utilizes this approach, the index constituentâ€™s data concept lists the constituents and their weights at regular intervals. 
* Index constituents and weights are calculated once an hour, every hour, including on weekends and holidays. 
* Single asset indexes only have a single constituent, so no data will be returned for this endpoint.

## **Example**

A sample of the index constituents data for the CMBI10 is shown below:

* asset:  The ID of the index constituent.
* weight: The index constituent weight.
