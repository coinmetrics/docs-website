# Index Constituents

## **Definition**

An index constituent is a member of an index.  For multi-asset crypto indexes, a constituent is a cryptoasset. &#x20;

## Details

Certain indexes consist of multiple index constituents. Such indexes weight constituents by one or more factors to determine the composition of the index. For instance, market capitalization-weighted indexes weight index constituents by their adjusted free float market capitalization. For each index that utilizes this approach, the index constituent data contains the constituents and their weights.&#x20;

Index constituents and weights are calculated once an hour, every hour, including on weekends and holidays. Single asset indexes only have a single constituent, so no data will be returned for this endpoint. There are also no constituents for our CMBI Mining Series indexes.&#x20;

## **Example**

A sample of the constituents for the CMBI10 from our [`/timeseries/index-constituents`](https://docs.coinmetrics.io/api/v4#operation/getTimeseriesIndexConstituents) API endpoint is  shown below.&#x20;
