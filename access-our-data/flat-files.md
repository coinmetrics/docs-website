# Flat Files

Our datasets are available via a flat files admin counsel.  This enables users to download a file for a specific data type for a specific exchange for a specific day. &#x20;

We currently support [trades](../market-data-timeseries/market-trades.md), market [candles](../market-data-timeseries/market-candles.md) and [quotes](../market-data-timeseries/market-quotes.md).  \
\
Flat file datasets for a given day are available on the next day around 05:00 UTC.
