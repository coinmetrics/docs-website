# R Client

R is an open-source programming language, popularly used for statistical computing and data analysis. The CM official R client provides a simple way to access all data available via the Coin Metrics' API using the R programming language. **Please note this is an initial implementation and is considered a beta product.**

Detailed documentation & installation instructions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/coinmetrics/api-client-r). Use this client to query all kinds of data.  By default, data from the API is returned as a tibble so it can be easily manipulated. For every API endpoint supported in the Coin Metrics [API Reference](https://docs.coinmetrics.io/api/v4), there is a related function that follows the same format.
