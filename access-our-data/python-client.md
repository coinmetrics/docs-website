# Python Client

The CM official Python client provides a simple way to access all data available via the Coin Metrics' API.  Detailed documentation & installation instructions can be found on [GitHub](https://coinmetrics.github.io/api-client-python/site/index.html).  Use this client to query all kinds of data.  In just a few lines of code, _anyone_ can access clean cryptocurrency data in a familiar form, such as a pandas dataframe. &#x20;

For a thorough walkthrough of what you can do with the community client, check out our [walkthrough](https://github.com/coinmetrics/api-client-python/blob/master/examples/notebooks/walkthrough\_community.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook form.  Examples of exporting data can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/coinmetrics/api-client-python/tree/master/examples) folder.
