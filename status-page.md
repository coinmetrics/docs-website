# Status Page

### **Subscribe to our Status Page**

We understand that a reliable data-feed with maximum uptime is critical to our customers. To monitor our data pipelines, we run numerous automated bots across all of our data production systems to ensure continuous production and alerting when unexpected delays/issues arise. 

When issues are detected, we alert our clients immediately through our [Status Page](https://status.coinmetrics.io/) and work to resolve the issue as expediently as possible. We provide updates as they are available, and notify clients as soon as we’ve implemented a resolution. We highly recommend that our customers subscribe to our Status Page for the operational statuses of anything that impacts the usage of our products:

* Services
  * **API**: REST and Websocket API covering all products.
  * **Website**: Covers the Coin Metrics website including main page and analytics.coinmetrics.io.
* Infrastructure
  * **Data Ingestion**: Infrastructure used to ingest data such as blockchain nodes and exchange scrapers.
  * **Data Processing**: Infrastructure used to store, structure, process, aggregate and calculate data to derive product metrics.
* Data Quality
  * **Reference Rates:** Data quality issues regarding the CM Hourly Reference Rates and CM Real-Time Reference Rates.

However, if there is an ongoing or recently resolved issue, there won’t be a check mark. Ongoing issues are written in red text and recently resolved issues are written in black text.
