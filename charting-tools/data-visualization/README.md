# Data Visualization

## Introduction

Our  Data Visualization offering includes three tools:

* [Charting tool](charting-tool/)
* [Formula builder](formula-builder.md)
* [Correlation tool](correlation-tool.md)

These tools allow for easy exploration of our network (on-chain data).  Users can select multiple assets and metrics to identify trends and insights or leverage our powerful formula builder to transform data series.   The correlation tool makes for simple correlation analysis.  All charts can be downloaded as PNGs and the charted data can be exported to CSV or XLS files.  And, you can save your charts for later or share them with others.

## Data Sources

All data is sourced from the CM v4 API. &#x20;

## Getting Started

This suite of charting tools can be accessed directly at [Charts](https://network-charts.coinmetrics.io) with or without an API key.   Without an API key, you will have access to the community data from the above[ data sources. ](./#data-sources)

### Using an API Key

If you are a client of our professional data and you have an API Viz key, you can enter your key by selecting the "key" on the top of the right toolbar.  If you are a client, and you do not have a Viz key, contact us to obtain one.  Each user needs their own Viz key, as these keys have special permisssions.  Also, any charts saved to our cloud are saved to your user-specific key. &#x20;

## Saving Charts

You can save your charts in all three of our tools.  Simply select the "save" image on the right toolbar.   There are two options for saving your charts:

* Save as... (only available to users with a Viz API key) - save your chart to your API key and reload it later from any device.  Charts saved to your API key can be "named" (given a title) and can be shared via a chart-specific URL.
* Save to local drive - save your chart to your local drive in a json format and reload it for later use.

![Click on the "disk" to find the Save Options](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-12-21-at-11.51.39-am.png)

## Loading Charts

To load a previously saved chart, select the "folder" image on the right toolbar.   If you saved your chart to your API key (to the Cloud), then "Load from cloud".  If you saved your chart to your local drive, then "Load from file".&#x20;

If you "Load from file", then find your file/chart using the explorer window.

## Sharing Charts

If you'd like to share a chart via a URL, you need an API via key.  Once your API key is set, then, click the "share" button. &#x20;

![Click on the "share" button to copy a sharable URL to the desktop](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-12-30-at-12.33.01-pm.png)

If you've already saved your chart, then ensure that "Sharing on" is green, and click the copy button to copy the URL to the clipboard.   If you haven't yet saved your chart, name the chart and then copy the URL to the clipboard.
