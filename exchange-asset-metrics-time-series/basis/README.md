# Basis

The basis is the annualized percent difference between the price of a theoretical futures contract and the price of its underlying spot market. Coin Metrics calculates this for several exchange-assets such as`binance-btc` and `ftx-eth`. We calculate four basis metrics at defined days to expiration.
