## Details

Market price per share reflects the closing price of the investment product's shares at 4PM ET on OTCQX®. To date, the Trust has not met its investment objective and the Shares quoted on OTCQX have not reflected the value of digital assets held by the Trust, less the Trust’s expenses and other liabilities, but instead have traded at both premiums and discounts to such value, with variations that have at times been substantial.
