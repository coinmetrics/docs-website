| Name                      | MetricID              | Category  | Subcategory | Type | Unit | Frequency |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---- | ---- | --------- |
| Grayscale Net Asset Value | \*\_net\_asset\_value | Grayscale | Products    | n/a  | USD  | 1d        |

The metric names are prefixed by the ticker symbol of the investment product, such as `gbtc_shares_outstanding` for Grayscale's Bitcoin Investment Trust.

## Details

The net asset value per share is calculated daily at 4pm ET, based on a CoinDesk price index. To date, the Trust has not met its investment objective and the Shares quoted on OTCQX have not reflected the value of digital assets held by the Trust, less the Trust’s expenses and other liabilities, but instead have traded at both premiums and discounts to such value, with variations that have at times been substantial.
