# Security Master Overview

The security master provides a consistent schema for accessing information about crypto assets and markets in a variety of downstream applications such as risk management, clearing and settlement, accounting, order management, execution management. Much like its counterparts in traditional finance, our security master is an organization-wide dataset that serves as the cornerstone for storing reference data encompassing fundamental, pricing, on-chain and off-chain data points for all major crypto assets within the digital asset space.

We also created our security master as part of our efforts to enhance our product offerings and allow for easier integration of our entire product suite, including Coin Metrics Network Data Pro, Coin Metrics Market Data Feed, and Coin Metrics Reference Data products.

## API Endpoints
