# CM Labs

[CM Labs](https://coinmetrics.io/cm-labs/) is a place for our pioneering team to experiment.  Here, you'll find associate passion projects, fun prototypes, and cutting edge efforts that are experimental in nature.  Many of our most popular commercial products have their roots in these innovative, community-first efforts.  

While CM Labs products and features are very cool, for one reason or another, we are not quite ready to incorporate them into our mainstream product offerings.  

In addition to the projects and prototypes you'll find on our CM Labs [site](https://coinmetrics.io/cm-labs/), you will also notice certain metrics and assets \(e.g., ICP\) flagged in our tools as CM Labs.

This flag also exists in our catalogs.  Experimental assets/metrics with have  `"experimental": true` in the array of objects returned for that asset/metric.

While we obviously feel there is value in making these experimental metrics/assets available, please exercise caution given their experimental nature.
