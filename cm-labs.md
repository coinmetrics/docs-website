# CM Labs

[CM Labs](https://coinmetrics.io/cm-labs/) is a place for our pioneering team to experiment.  Here, you'll find associate passion projects and fun prototypes.  You'll also find cutting edge efforts that are experimental in nature.  May of our most popular commercial products have their roots in these innovative, community-first efforts.  

While CM Labs products/features are very cool, for one reason or another, we are not quite ready to incorporate these features into our mainstream product offerings.  

In addition to the projects and prototypes you'll find on our CM Labs [site](https://coinmetrics.io/cm-labs/), you will also notice certain metrics and assets \(e.g., ICP\) flagged in our tools as CM Labs.

This flag also exists in our catalogs.  While we obviously feel there is value in making these available, please exercise caution when leveraging these assets and metrics given their experimental nature.
