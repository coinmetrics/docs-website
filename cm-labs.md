# CM Labs

[CM Labs](https://coinmetrics.io/cm-labs/) is a place for our pioneering team to experiment.  Here, you'll find associate passion projects, fun prototypes, and cutting edge efforts that are experimental in nature.  Many of our most popular commercial products have their roots in these innovative, community-first efforts. &#x20;

While CM Labs products and features are very cool, for one reason or another, we are not quite ready to incorporate them into our mainstream product offerings. &#x20;

## Identification of CM Labs Efforts

In addition to the projects and prototypes you'll find on our CM Labs [site](https://coinmetrics.io/cm-labs/), you will also notice certain metrics and assets (e.g., ICP) flagged in our tools as CM Labs. &#x20;

This flag also exists in our catalogs.  Experimental assets/metrics with have `"experimental": true` in the array of objects returned for that asset/metric.

```
 }, {
    "asset" : "icp",
    "full_name" : "Internet Computer",
    "experimental" : true,
    "metrics" : [ {
      "metric" : "AdrAct30dCnt",
      "frequencies" : [ {
        "frequency" : "1d",
        "min_time" : "2021-05-06T00:00:00.000000000Z",
        "max_time" : "2021-08-23T00:00:00.000000000Z"
      } ]
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
While we obviously feel there is value in making these experimental assets/metrics available, please exercise caution given their experimental nature. &#x20;

## Examples of Labs Efforts

Below are some examples of Labs efforts:

* Experimental on-chain asset coverage in NDP and Atlas (e.g., ICP, DOT, ALGO, XTZ)
* DeFi Market Data (i.e., Uniswap and Sushiswap swaps, liquidity pool metadata, candles, and volume metrics)
* Farum Risk Management offerings (e.g., WatchTower Alerts (`/asset-alerts`), Mining Pool Monitor (`/mining-pool-tips-summary`), Reorg & Fork Tracker (`/asset-chains`)
