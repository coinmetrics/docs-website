# Market Data Overview

The [CM Market Data Feed](https://coinmetrics.io/market-data-feed/) \(MDF\) provides access to historical and real-time data from the worldâ€™s leading spot and derivatives crypto exchanges. We offer a wide range of harmonized datasets such as trades, candles, order book snapshots, several futures-specific data types, several options-specific data types, several market data metrics, and more. ****

Our data is available at several different levels: asset, exchange, market, asset pair, exchange-asset pair, and institution. Our coverage universe currently consists of 2,171 assets, 34 exchanges, 12,553 spot markets, 6,353 futures markets, 14,883 options markets, 2,698 asset pairs, 2,595 exchange-asset pairs, and one institution. 

## Data Available at Market Level 

Many of our data types are available at the market level. We define a market as a specific listed pair or derivatives contract that trades on a specific exchange, like `coinbase-btc-usd-spot` or `binance-BTCUSDT-future` or `deribit-BTC-16MAY21-58000-C-option`. The market coverage can be found by querying our [`/catalog/markets`](https://docs.coinmetrics.io/api/v4#operation/getCatalogMarkets) or [`/catalog-all/markets`](https://docs.coinmetrics.io/api/v4#operation/getCatalogAllMarkets) API endpoints.
