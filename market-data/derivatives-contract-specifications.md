# Market Metadata

## **Definition**

Market metadata includes descriptive and reference data about the listed markets on an exchange. The market metadata can include data about the trading parameters that govern valid orders such as amount and price precision, fees, current status, and several fields that describe a derivatives market contract specifications.

This data is served through our[`/catalog/markets`](https://docs.coinmetrics.io/api/v4#operation/getCatalogMarkets) and [`/catalog-all/markets`](https://docs.coinmetrics.io/api/v4#operation/getCatalogAllMarkets) HTTP API endpoints.

## Details

Coin Metrics collects and serves metadata for **spot**, **futures**, and **options** markets.

Some metadata is available for all three market types. This includes data about the base asset and quote asset (or underlying base asset and quote asset for derivatives), the exchange-reported symbol, the market status, amount precision, maximum and minimum amount size, price precision, maximum and minimum price, and fee fields.

Spot markets also have a field that indicates whether the market allows margin trading.

Futures markets have several fields that describe the futures market's contract specifications. Futures markets trade in standardized contracts that allow counterparties to enter into an agreement to buy or sell a standardized asset under contract specifications that are defined by the exchange. The futures contract specifications include information such as the underlying base and quote asset, the margin asset, the contract size, the listing time, expiration time, and other terms. Here we define futures to include both non-perpetual futures that expire and perpetual futures (sometimes called perpetual swaps).

Options markets also trade in standardized contracts similar to futures markets described above. Options markets have several fields that are specific to options such as the strike price and whether the option is an European or American style option.

## **Example**

A sample of the futures and options contract specification data from our [`/catalog/markets`](https://docs.coinmetrics.io/api/v4#operation/getCatalogMarkets) and [`/catalog-all/markets`](https://docs.coinmetrics.io/api/v4#operation/getCatalogAllMarkets) API endpoints is shown below.&#x20;

## Frequently Asked Questions&#x20;

### Do all exchanges offer these metadata fields?

Exchanges vary in which fields they offer through their API. If an exchange does not offer a particular field, Coin Metrics will consult the exchange's published documentation and manually populate some fields. If neither the exchange's API nor documentation can be used to populate a field, then that field is omitted from the response for that particular market.

### **Is the `margin_asset` the asset of settlement?**&#x20;

Yes, the `margin_asset` is the asset of settlement. A trader must post this asset as the initial margin when opening a position**.** Unrealized gains and losses are calculated in this asset, and a trader receives gains or losses denominated in this asset when the trader closes the position or the contract expires.&#x20;

### **Is there a way to filter between perpetual, coin-margined, and tether-margined futures in the catalog?**

We are working on adding filtering parameters for the various futures contract types. In the meantime, perp contracts can be identified by null `expiration` time. Coin margined contracts can be identified where the `base` is identical to `margin_asset`. Tether margined contracts can be identified where the `margin_asset` is `usdt`.

## Harmonization Discussion&#x20;

Harmonization of derivatives contracts in the cryptoasset domain is difficult because there is wide disparity in contract design and exchange conventions. Some of the sources of difficulty include:

* The margin asset can be in the form of the underlying base asset, a stablecoin such as Tether, or a fiat currency. \

* The contract size (the amount of notional exposure that a single contract is worth) can be in the form of varying units such as the underlying base asset or a fiat currency. Some exchanges use exotic futures design (such as BitMEX's quanto contracts) where the contract size is not fixed but rather a function of the current price. \

* Some exchanges offer exotic futures contracts where the underlying is not a cryptoasset. Instead, it could be a custom index, an equity, or something else like Bitcoin's hash rate. \

* Some exchanges hide the complexity involved with contract sizes and do not use contract sizes. Instead, they allow users to define the amount of units of the underlying base asset when trading and allow users to purchase fractional contracts (representing fractional units of the underlying) to simulate spot trading. Other exchanges explicitly define contract sizes and do not allow users to purchase fractional contracts.\

* Some exchanges separate perpetual swap contracts that have no expiration date and traditional futures contracts with a specified expiration date. These exchanges serve contract information via two different endpoints with different response schema.\

* Some exchanges do not provide all contract specification data via their API but instead define it in documentation.

We harmonize the data in the following way:&#x20;

* For exchanges that do not explicitly define the contract size and implicitly use a contract size of 1 unit of the underlying base asset, we set the contract size to 1.\

* In instances where the exchange's API does not contain all fields that we wish to capture, we consult the exchange's documentation and manually populate the data.
