## Introduction

The Coin Metricsâ€™ Trusted Exchange Framework thus aims to quantitatively assess exchanges to promote transparency, innovation, and trust for the industry and its users. The common usage patterns for an exchange  are translated to criteria that  define the fundamental properties of exchange trustworthiness: transparency, resilience & security, data quality, regulatory compliance, and API quality. The criteria sources public information about an exchange such as incident history, financial statements, and license disclosure as well as market activity that can be derived from exchange data.
